# Business Rule Templates Gallery  

*Your shortcut to smarter data quality – with a little help from HEDDA.IO.*  

Welcome to the **Business Rule Templates Gallery** – your shortcut to smarter data quality!  

This repository is a growing collection of ready-to-use business rules provided by us and the community. The idea is simple: why reinvent the wheel when you can benefit from qualified, commonly needed rules (and even some you might not have thought about yet)?  

## Why use it?  
Because it gives you a quick start and fast wins in your own projects. Import proven rules, adapt them to your domains, and immediately raise the quality of your data.  

## How it works  
- Create a new Rulebook in HEDDA.IO  
- Use the **Import** tab to bring in templates from this repo  
- Map the domains used in the rules (e.g., `email` → your own `e_mail`, `mail`, etc.)  
- Run the validation directly on your data

## Contribute  
Got a useful rule? Share it!  
Just open a Pull Request. We’ll review it for quality and relevance, and if it fits, it becomes part of the gallery for everyone.  

## License  
All rules are MIT licensed – free to use, adapt, and build upon.
